      <!-- Var, let, Const -->
      <h1 class="text-center text-xl text-black font-semibold mb-4 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 rounded-md">
        1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
      </h1>
      <!-- Var -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Var:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          Basically variable declared with var is both function scope & and
          global scope. That means we can access them before they are declared
          in our code. If a var variable is declared outside of any function,
          it becomes a global variable and accessible throughout our entire
          code. Possible to reassign and update.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Let -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5 mt-2">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Let:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          Mainly let variables have block scope. They are only accessible within the block. If we declare let within a
          function, let variables are limited to that function's scope.

          Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values within their scope. This means we can change the
          value of a let variable as many times as we want within it's block.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Const -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5 mt-2">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Const:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          const variables are also block-scoped, this means they are only accessible within the block of code where they
          are defined. It cannot be reassigned to a different value within the same scope.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Null, Undefined -->
      <h1 class="text-center text-xl text-black font-semibold mb-4 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 mt-4 rounded-md">
        2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
      </h1>
      <!-- Null -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5 mt-2">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Null:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          null represents an empty or missing value in many programming languages, including JavaScript. It's used to
          signify the absence of an object or a variable that should have a value but does not have value.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Undefined -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5 mt-2">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Undefined:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          undefined is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a defined value. When trying to
          access an object property that does not exist, then undefined occurs. When a function
          does not return a value explicitly, it returns undefined by default.
        </p>

      <!--  REST API -->
      <h1 class="text-center text-xl text-black font-semibold mb-4 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 rounded-md mt-3">
        3. What do you mean by REST API?
      </h1>
      <!-- Undefined -->
      <div class="bg-green-100 rounded-md px-5 py-5 mt-2">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">API:</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          Basically API is the bridge of communication between different software components, enabling them to interact
          and exchange data with each other. For example if we order something in a restaurant where a waiter take
          orders from us and go to the kitchen and bring our ordered items for us. Here the waiter is like an API. Here
          the client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network.
